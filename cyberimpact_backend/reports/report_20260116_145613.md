## Detailed Findings

## Tool: semgrep (sast)

### Essential Findings (7 issues)

#### 🟢 Finding 1

- **File:** `db/index.js`
- **Line:** 10
- **Severity:** WARNING
- **Rule ID:** javascript.lang.security.audit.sqli.node-postgres-sqli.node-postgres-sqli
- **Message:** Detected string concatenation with a non-literal variable in a node-postgres JS SQL statement. This could lead to SQL injection if the variable is user-controlled and not properly sanitized. In order to prevent SQL injection, use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead. You can use parameterized statements like so: `client.query('SELECT $1 from table', [userinput])`

#### 🟢 Finding 2

- **File:** `docker/Dockerfile`
- **Line:** 10
- **Severity:** ERROR
- **Rule ID:** dockerfile.security.missing-user.missing-user
- **Message:** By not specifying a USER, a program in the container may run as 'root'. This is a security hazard. If an attacker can control a process running as root, they may have control over the container. Ensure that the last USER in a Dockerfile is a USER other than 'root'.

#### 🟢 Finding 3

- **File:** `k8s/deployment.yaml`
- **Line:** 8
- **Severity:** INFO
- **Rule ID:** yaml.kubernetes.security.run-as-non-root.run-as-non-root
- **Message:** When running containers in Kubernetes, it's important to ensure that they  are properly secured to prevent privilege escalation attacks.  One potential vulnerability is when a container is allowed to run  applications as the root user, which could allow an attacker to gain  access to sensitive resources. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to  add a `securityContext` to the container, with the parameter `runAsNonRoot`  set to `true`. This will ensure that the container runs as a non-root user,  limiting the damage that could be caused by any potential attacks. By  adding a `securityContext` to the container in your Kubernetes pod, you can  help to ensure that your containerized applications are more secure and  less vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks.

#### 🟢 Finding 4

- **File:** `k8s/deployment.yaml`
- **Line:** 12
- **Severity:** WARNING
- **Rule ID:** yaml.kubernetes.security.allow-privilege-escalation.allow-privilege-escalation
- **Message:** In Kubernetes, each pod runs in its own isolated environment with its own set of security policies. However, certain container images may contain `setuid` or `setgid` binaries that could allow an attacker to perform privilege escalation and gain access to sensitive resources. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to add a `securityContext` to the container in the pod, with the parameter `allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `false`. This will prevent the container from running any privileged processes and limit the impact of any potential attacks. By adding the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` parameter to your the `securityContext`, you can help to ensure that your containerized applications are more secure and less vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks.

#### 🟢 Finding 5

- **File:** `middleware/authMiddleware.js`
- **Line:** 11
- **Severity:** ERROR
- **Rule ID:** javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-none-alg.jwt-none-alg
- **Message:** Detected use of the 'none' algorithm in a JWT token. The 'none' algorithm assumes the integrity of the token has already been verified. This would allow a malicious actor to forge a JWT token that will automatically be verified. Do not explicitly use the 'none' algorithm. Instead, use an algorithm such as 'HS256'.

#### 🟢 Finding 6

- **File:** `server.js`
- **Line:** 8
- **Severity:** INFO
- **Rule ID:** javascript.express.security.audit.express-check-csurf-middleware-usage.express-check-csurf-middleware-usage
- **Message:** A CSRF middleware was not detected in your express application. Ensure you are either using one such as `csurf` or `csrf` (see rule references) and/or you are properly doing CSRF validation in your routes with a token or cookies.

#### 🟢 Finding 7

- **File:** `services/auth.js`
- **Line:** 8
- **Severity:** WARNING
- **Rule ID:** javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-hardcode.hardcoded-jwt-secret
- **Message:** A hard-coded credential was detected. It is not recommended to store credentials in source-code, as this risks secrets being leaked and used by either an internal or external malicious adversary. It is recommended to use environment variables to securely provide credentials or retrieve credentials from a secure vault or HSM (Hardware Security Module).
